An Obsidian theme.

## Development
Start up `npm run sass-dev` to auto-update `theme.css` as you work with the theme.

Restart Obsidian to see changes.

Once everything looks good, fire off `npm version {type}` to increment and push
a version bump (https://semver.org/):
- `npm version major` version when you make incompatible API changes
- `npm version minor` version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- `npm version patch` version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
